# Simple Chromium Updater (chrupd.cmd)

Uses RSS feed from "chromium.woolyss.com" to download and install latest Chromium version, if a newer version is available. Options can be set in script or using command line arguments (try "chrupd.cmd -h")

 - default is to get the "stable" 64-bit "nosync" Installer by "Nik"
 - verifies sha1/md5 hash and runs installer
 
NOTE: for easy execution this PowerShell script is embedded in a Batch .CMD file using a "polyglot wrapper". It can be renamed to chrupd.ps1. More info:
